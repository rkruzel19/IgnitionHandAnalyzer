1/1/21 
- Changelog created 
- Created basic Tournament, Hand, Player components
- Added a tournament.txt file to directory for testing 
- Created IgnitionMapper to read tournament.txt file and pull needed values using regex
    - Then creates a Tournament component using pulled values
    - Currently reads 1st line of Hand (tournament info) and pulls handId, tournamentId, timeStamp
    - Simple display to show that its working

1/4/21
- Bug in IgnitionMapper when applying regex to fields that were empty due to bad rendering flow. 
    - Fixed by adding "Upload File" button which imports the txt file, then creates fields, finally returns Tournament component

1/5/21
- Made Mappers folder in components. Tournament, Hand, and Player will have a Mapper to pull the necessary data from txt file and 
  create the approriate component.
- IgnitionMapper => TournamentMapper => HandMapper => PlayerMapper

1/9/21
- Implemented Tournament, Hand, and Player mapper classes. 
- Added css to each to easily show on UI what text is from what component
- Added regex to Hand and Player to start pulling data from textFile
- Basic flow is complete. IGmapper calls TournyMapper calls HandMapper calls PlayerMapper. All goes back to overall Tournament component
